					<h2>WTH is Horror?</h2>
					<p id="testP">Merriam-Webster defines horror as : A painful and intense, fear, dread, or dismay.
                  <br>That sounds horrible, but when used as a vessel for storytelling it can do a whole lot more than just scare you.
                  <br>So let me officailly welcome you to my Ted Talk. Learning through horror, or alternatively How I learned to love the scare. </p>

					<h2>Horro's Reach</h2>
					<p> Name's such as, Michael Myers, PennyWise, Krueger, The Scream evoke a feeling that can be summed up as "Yeah I don't want to run into that guy."
                  <br>Now you'll say that these are all just fictional, they don't extend to real life. Is that true though?
                  <br>An abandoned house with a history of unfortunate events, a portrait that seems to follow your every move.
                  <br>That lonely road surrounded by trees  you won't ever take cause it reminds you of that one scene.
                  <br>These are examples of the reach that horror as a genre has outside of it's respective mediums. 
                  <br>It turns the mundane into the extraordiany, but it doesn't just end at loss of hope.
                  <br>If anything it leads us to one important super important point coming up. Triumph.

					<h2>F.E.A.R</h2>
					<p> Now let's talk about F.E.A.R an acronym that has two definition's in regards to horror.
                  <br>There is the typical response definition Forget Everythings And Run, which is what we have when faced with what seems like an unwinnable situation.
                  <br>I mean you see something like a Xenomporh from Alien's running at you, there is no other response outside of getting the hell out of dodge and there is nothing wrong with that.
                  <br>However even the scared has to turn towards the threat and say enough is enough. This is the point where the other definition comes in, Face Everything And Rise.
                  <br>What the Xenomporh, Freddy, Pennywise, and ther est have in common is that they were eventually defeated by the ones who were afraid of them. </p>

					<h2>The Lesson Learned</h2>
					<p> This was just a simple set up to talk about my favorite genre Horror, and what it can do beyond just giving you a scare.
                  <bg>Horror teaches that no matter what the monster is there is a time to run away, but eventually you have to face it. 
                  <bg>And it's the same as programming, the idea of making something as simple as a barebones website feel like a daunting task.
                  <bg>JavaScript, CSS, HTML, and the variables included are nothing more than the typical horror movie villains.
                  <bg>And just the same as those villains, they can be conquered.
